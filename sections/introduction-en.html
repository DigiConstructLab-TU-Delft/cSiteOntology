Construction sites generate a variety of data from tools such as 3D/4D BIM models, delivery tracking systems, Excel-based 
weekly look-aheads, and document control platforms. These systems often lack semantic alignment, making integration and 
automation difficult.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>cSite Ontology</strong> was developed as part of a research collaboration between University College London, TU Delft, 
and the University of Sydney to serve as a semantic integration layer for production control environments. The ontology supports 
tracking of spatial progress, resource utilisation, activity completion, document workflows, and subcontractor performance.
</p>
<p>
The ontology was designed through a hybrid process involving real-world case studies, reuse of existing ontologies, and 
collaborative design workshops with construction stakeholders. It is implemented in OWL and supports SPARQL querying 
for generating dashboard-ready metrics.
