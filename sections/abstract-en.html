<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
<p>
The <strong>cSite Ontology</strong> is a semantic model for improving production control in construction projects. 
It enables integration of data across construction activities, spatial locations, resources, and documents.
By aligning with established ontologies such as BOT, BFO, PROV, and DICE, the cSite ontology supports interoperable 
information modeling for construction digital twins and immersive control rooms.

<p>
This ontology was developed to address the fragmentation and inefficiencies caused by data silos on construction sites.
It supports dynamic querying, real-time analysis, and visualisation of production metrics for better decision-making.
